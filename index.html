                            <p>- Dear Daniel is a Japanese male bobcat that is on of Hello Kitty's childhood bestfriend and boyfriend.</p>

                            <!--Explaining to the user why Dear Daniel is not ranked higher.-->
                            <em>Why was he not higher on the list?</em>
                            <p>His character does not show depth, he was only known as a companion. This makes his character come across as boring and forgettable. In my opinion, his character had potential but the production company turned it into a mediocre background character.</p>

                            <p>- Gudetama is a genderless egg that gives off the impression of laziness due to them always being shown laying down.</p>

                            <!--Explaining to the user why Gudetama is not ranked higher.-->
                            <p>His character does not do anything but lay down and show laziness. Personally, I am not fond of laziness and I believe that their character has contributed to a rise of laziness. However, the character is popular because a lot of young people find it relatable.</p>

                            <p>Tuxedo Sam is a penguin born in Antarctica, in the South Pole but immigrated to the country of England. He is fluent in English and Penguinese, he is always open to learning new languages.</p>

                            <p>Despite his short-lived relationship with Hello Kitty, Tuxedo Sam is a well-rounded and educated character who serves as an inspiration to the youth. I admire his sense of fashion, he collects bow ties and has a total of 365. Those attributes and his ability to build relationships with others in the Sanrio universe make him a strong and well-rounded character. He is a fan among the Sanio-loving community.</p>
